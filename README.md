# Data_Science_Capstone_Project:  Arvato Customer Segmentation and Prediction

This exercise is the final project of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Program.

The purpose of this project is to compare demographics data information for the general population of an specified city with the demographics data of customers of mail-orders.
We need to use unsupervised learning techniques to perform customer segmentation (extracting the best features of the population that describ the best customers base), and 
supervised learning techniques to predict which individuals could be the most likely to become customers for the financial company.

3. DIAS Attributes - Values 2017.xlsx and DIAS Information Levels - Attributes 2017.xlsx - The dictionary of the features. 

## Submission Instructions

### What to Submit

### Required

If you submit a web application, you only need to submit a link to your Github repository. In this case, since you won't be writing up a separate
report, you need to make sure to address the Project Definition, Analysis, and Conclusion sections of the rubric in your README file, or in your 
Jupyter Notebook if you provide one.

If you submit a blog post, you will need to submit two links - one for your GitHub repo and one for your blog post. The audience for your blog post
should be that of a technical audience member. Your GitHub repo should contain your code (if possible), dataset (unless you chose the Spark project 
option), and README.md files.
